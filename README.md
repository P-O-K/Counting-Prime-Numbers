# Counting-Prime-Numbers


This program was inspired by Dave Plummers youtube videos on "Software Drag Racing": ( https://www.youtube.com/c/DavesGarage )

Question at hand:
    
    Write a sieve to count all the prime numbers of 10^6 as many times as possible in 5 seconds?

CountingPrimesBasePy -> Uses the purest form of python with no other dependencies.

CountingPrimesNumpy -> Although the sieve is ment to be used with the base language, this uses numpy just to see how far it could be pushed.
