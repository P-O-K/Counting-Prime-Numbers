# Counting-Prime-Numbers


This program was inspired by Dave Plummers youtube videos on "Software Drag Racing": ( https://www.youtube.com/c/DavesGarage )

Question at hand:
    
    Write a sieve to count all the prime numbers of 10^6 as many times as possible in 5 seconds?
    
Although it is supposed to be used with the base programing language, I used numpy to see just how far it could be pushed.
